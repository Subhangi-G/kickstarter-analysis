# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview of Project

### Purpose

To uncover hidden trends between crowdfunding campaign outcomes and their launch dates.\
To find if there is any relationship between outcomes of crowdfunding campaigns and the goals set for their fund collections


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A table was created that showed the numbers of successful, failed and canceled crowdfunding campaigns for every month. This was done by first extracting the years from when the different campaigns and then creating a pivot table.\
This way the outcome of a campaign could be correlated to the month that it was launched.\
The data was distilled for the category of theatre only. This was done to see how crowdfunding campaigns to fund theatre projects perfomed when launched in different months because the client wanted to compare with her own campaign of fundraising for her play.\
To visualize, a line-chart showing the number of successful, failed, and canceled theatre projects for each month was created.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

A table was created that showed data for the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for plays within different ranges of goals for funds.\
The goal amounts were bracketed in the ranges of less than 1000, greater then 50000, and in between range brackets of 5000.\
Percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns were then calculated for each range.  
A line chart was plotted showing the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled against the different range brackets. This was done to uncover trends, if any, between the funding goals for a campaign and it's success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges were ecountered during this analysis. However if the category theatre had contained other subcategories that made a big impact on the launch month, then this first analysis would not have been an accurate representation. Here that doesn't seem to be the case.\
In the analysis of outcomes based on goals, the total number of projects with goals of $25000 and above decrease substantially. This decreases the trustworthiness of the outcomes for the goal ranges above this amount.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1) Out of the 1369 total campaigns for raising funds for theatre, the 111 launched in May were most successful.\
The best time to launch a campaign for theatre is between Apr. and July.

2) The number of canceled campaigns were very low and remained almost steady over the months which might imply that their cancellation may not be dependent upon when they were launched.\
Similarly the number of failed campaigns also did not vary as much as the successful ones, but showed a similar trend to them being slightly elevated from Apr. through August, and in Oct. This could be bacause most campaigns for plays are launched during these months. Or maybe the faliure of theatre campaigns may not be completely dependent on the month of launch.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1) Crowdfunding campaigns for plays were most successful when their goal amounts were less than $5000.\
For a comparable number of total projects, those with goal amounts between $5000 to $9999, had may be slightly higher likelyhood of being successful.

2) Campaigns for goals between $10,000 to $ 25000 also showed similar likelyhood of success and faliure. 

3) The trend seems to that asking above $20000, to fund plays, will likely result in a failed project, except for the range beween $35000-$40000. However this conclusion may not be relaible because the there aren't many projects in the ranges above $20000.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

1) The number of campaigns for plays that have a very high goal amount (above $25000) is very limited.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1) An analysis of outcomes based on goals could be performed for all projects to study the effect of goals on general on raising funds through crowdfunding.

2) The outcomes of projects by launch dates could be studied separately in different countries.
